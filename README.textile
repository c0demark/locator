h1. Locator

This library aims to extract common html element selection from testing tools such as "Webrat":http://github.com/brynary/webrat/blob/master/lib/webrat/core/locators.rb, "Capybara":http://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/blob/master/lib/capybara/xpath.rb or "Steam":http://github.com/svenfuchs/steam/blob/master/lib/steam/locators.rb.

At its core it constructs "XPath":http://github.com/svenfuchs/locator/blob/master/lib/locator/xpath.rb objects using a simple "boolean expression engine":http://github.com/svenfuchs/locator/blob/master/lib/locator/boolean.rb in order to locate elements in a Nokogiri DOM. It provides a bunch of "Element classes":http://github.com/svenfuchs/locator/blob/master/lib/locator/element.rb that are targeted at implementing a Webrat-style DSL for convenience.
